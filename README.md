# uiuc-rso-tips
This repository will have some [UNOFFICIAL] tips helpful for RSOs at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Here, I hope to host a set of resources that I know about which are available to RSOs for free (or for very cheap, should it be practical).
The target audience is executive board members who can't (or don't want to) spend a lot of time on the setup of basic infrastructure.
Learning is good, but I think that it is best for boards to focus on what matters (RSO-specific content).

Here, you should be able to find a set of resources that will be very useful for RSOs with regards to the "boring" stuff.


## Contributing
I am using GitHub to host this information. 
Git allows you to see changes between editions (read: commits), and GitHub has infrastructure such that issues can be opened if information needs to be updated, and an infrastructure to allow people to contribute.
That being said, you'll need a GitHub account in order to make issues and propose changes.
